ABOUT

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdwsl/stickman-test/screenshot.png)

This is a simple program that draws a stickman on the
screen. This stickman is built up of joints and behaves
a bit like a ragdoll. Later, I feel like I could build
upon this to implement some animation or ragdoll physics.

COMPILING

To compile, you'll need g++ and SDL2-dev
